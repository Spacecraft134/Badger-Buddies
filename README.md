# Badger Buddies

Badger Buddies is a React-based cat adoption application built to demonstrate **multi-page routing**, **state management**, and **Bootstrap-based responsive design**. It uses real cat adoption data from [The Madison Cat Project](https://www.madisoncatproject.org/).

**Disclaimer:** This project was originally developed as part of a university course (CS571 at UW–Madison). Certain features (such as the live adoption data) require the CS571 course API and will **not function outside the course environment**. This repository is for **demonstration and learning purposes only**.
